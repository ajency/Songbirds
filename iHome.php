Ample green with trees and ponds kept as they are, in  company of various birds, there is more than one reason why Songbirds  residents will spend a lot of time outdoors and experience unplanned  interactions and bonding.</p>

All homes are built with livable spaces, with every inch covered carefully, leaving no scope for any non-productive or protruding area in and around your home. Adequately spaced structures along with the angular placement of the window view allow zero intrusion of privacy in your Songbirds home. Every home comes built in with the basic structure of connectivity and placement  of any electronic  appliance or gadget in the most useful ways that residents can plug in.</p>
